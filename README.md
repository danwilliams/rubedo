# Rubedo

Rubedo is a set of library crates that provide useful utilities, helpers, and
other functionality for Rust projects.

The main crate is [`rubedo`](crates/rubedo/README.md), and the other crates
rely on it or provide secondary functionality in some way. This repository as
a whole shares a name with the main crate. You can read about the naming and
purpose of each crate in their respective README files.
